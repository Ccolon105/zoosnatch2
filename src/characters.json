Seeing that is is extremely unlikely that you will find another massive animal to suppress your hunger, you start to think rationally. That is until you smell a faint smell of smoke in the near distance. It’s not the smoke of a forest fire, but the smell of a human-home. Curious, you look around to see a small, lonesome cabin with a faint bit of smoke rising from the chimney. You peak into the home to see that there are three bowls of unattended porridge sitting on the table. It looks like only the middle bowl has been eaten and no one else is around. What are the chances of that? As you get ready to enter, a movement catches your eye… It’s a small, blonde human-girl sleeping in one of the beds… “NOT ANOTHER HUMAN!” You think to yourself… but then again…this could be another one of these perfect scenarios of getting porridge AND a human treat to eat...

You sit down, feeling satisfied as you grab the small bowl of porridge. “EW! this porridge is way too cold!” You spit it out over the table and reach for the last bowl. As you take a bite, you roar in pain. “OWW! This porridge is way too hot!” You realize why the human ate the other bowl, it must have been just right.. Just as that though finished, the door swings open and there stands three angry bears. The baby bear begins to scream in horror and Momma and Pappa Bear see the human carcass draped over their new egyptian cotton sheets… They roar in rage and attack you ruthlessly.

You start to salivate over the thought of it all. Finally, you hear buzzing! You track down the source of the buzzing and sure enough, a plethora of bees around the hive! As you get closer you realize the hive looks different from those down in the forest… this one is much darker and the honey bees are also darker, longer and are not as fluffy and nice looking.

You’ve made a long journey and you can see the mountain tops covered in snow which means hibernation is just around the corner.

You realize, these are no honey bees, these are huge hornets. You let your honey-goggles steer you wrong! The Hornets start a barrage of stinging as you try to run away.

Well, not quite… As you sleep, you are blasted with a cold wind. You are startled awake to find out a massive snowstorm swept through and has sealed you in the cave. You try to dig your way out but you have no energy and very little oxygen left in the small cave. You try to dig your way out, which knocks loose a support rock that is keeping the cave from collapsing.

Never being in contact with a snow monkey before, you try to understand their loud yelling at each other. Are they trying to help you or are they afraid that you are a threat?

One monkey runs off after discussion and comes back with a tarp that some humans must have left behind in the past. They roll you on to the tarp and begin to pull you through the snowy forest. You’re eyes open to the feeling of warmth. It looks like they put you next to a fire! Gratefully you try to roll over to try to thank them when you realize you’re tied up. “Maybe this is just a safety precaution?” you think… that is until the Alpha Monkey comes up, stairs you in the eyes and makes a gesture with his thumb across his throat. The other monkeys grab sharpened sticks and begin to stab you.
